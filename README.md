# Angular To-do List (Complete)

This is the complete solution to the NYP DSC 2024 Intro to Angular workshop, project section.

The folder structure is as follows:

### `project`

The folder inside which all Angular files were generated. When building the project, starting from the top level of this repo, type:

```
cd project
ng serve --open
```

### `prototype`

The folder which shows how the website will roughly look in the end, but without implementing any functionality yet. Contains `.html` files, from which we'll be copying HTML and CSS code from. See the README.md in this folder for more information.
